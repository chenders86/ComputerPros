With this project I wanted to create a â€œmock" app for my employer, as to show my boss some of the nice benefits of potentially having a personally branded app. We are a computer sales and service shop, specializing in Apple, Lenovo, and Microsoft products. 

My boss is implementing a cloud storage and computer maintenance service that I do not have access to at the moment called ProCare Cloud, and I created a faux landing page to display how it could be integrated into the app. The cloud button on the main page is only there to show an example of what we could implement. Since I do not have access to the account there is not much functionality to be added yet.

The app is pretty self explanatory, a user can book on-sites with with a tech, visit our social media pages, contact us right from the app, check our inventory, and save their passwords - just in case they are one of many customers who are always forgetting their login credentials. Some of these features I have implemented are limited by the simulator, and cannot be fully utilized e.g. calling and emailing right from the Contact Us page.
